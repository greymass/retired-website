Today we are happy to announce an exciting new use case for Anchor— Bitfinex’s non-custodial, on-chain exchange [eosfinex](https://www.eosfinex.com/).
​


eosfinex is a high-throughput, non-custodial exchange built on EOS. Not only is it built by the team behind [Bitfinex](https://www.bitfinex.com/), one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, but it also gives EOS users access to Bitfinex liquidity. While eosfinex order matching takes place off-chain, settlement and custody are entirely on-chain, leaving users in control of their assets.  


​
We are excited that Anchor has been supported by eosfinex since its launch. eosfinex will bring an important new service to the EOS community, and we’re happy to help support that vision. Because of their direct integration with Bitfinex, eosfinex will be able to offer liquidity previously unseen in non-custodial exchanges. The eosfinex mission is “to enable economical, user-friendly, and performant non-custodial trading of the world’s most popular digital assets.” We’re happy to help users access this new platform while retaining control of their tokens in Anchor.
